To add a new crafting staion, just add the image to this folder.

*Note: Name the image with a name you'll understand to find it easier when placing tiles.

**Note: The files are read alphabetically, so if you add a new image, it may mess up existing crafting stations.
To avoid this happening, put a number in front of the image name, eg. "1-anvil.png", so that the files are read
in the order you want.

**Note: Removing files will mess up existing crafting stations.
